## Elements: A Smart (and Touching) Investment 
The story behind this elegant 262-foot superyacht is more unique than most. When the person who originally commissioned Elements suddenly withdrew, the owner of Yachtley, the Turkish shipyard building the ship, made a bold decision to invest in his craftspeople and fund the completion of the yacht himself. The decision turned out to be a good one. Renowned Italian designer Christiano Gatto joined the team and transformed the interior into an elaborate masterpiece. Elements reaches an impressive 17-knot cruising speed and features cushy accommodations for 24 guests in 12 staterooms. And there’s a few extra perks on-board including a Turkish bath and sauna on the beach deck, a garage for jet-skis and an even elevator to transport guests between the main and bridge decks. 

Welcome to the lobby, it only gets better from here.

We weren’t joking, the opulent lounge area is a testament to the incredible work of renowned Italian designer, Christiano Gatto.

Dinner conversation is always a bit more interesting when the dining room looks like this.

Following dinner, Element’s guests can enjoy a nightcap with a very classy game of cards.

But while there isn’t a single room that disappoints, nothing drops the jaw quite like the sumptuous owner’s suite.
