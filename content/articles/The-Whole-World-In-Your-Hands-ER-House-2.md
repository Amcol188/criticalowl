Twain called Lake Tahoe the â€˜fairest picture the whole world affords.' For a cool $75 million, the fairest home on this already picturesque lake can be yours.

The property was built in 1997 by Jack Dreyfus, a Wall Street bigwig who founded an eponymous mutual fund (and is also the father of comedienne Julia Louis Dreyfus). It was sold for $50 million to current owner Stuart Yount, CEO of construction product company Fortifiber. Yount put the property up for sale in July 2017, and it has remained the most expensive home on the Tahoe market since.

Crystal Pointe is nestled in the idyllic Tahoe forest and includes a main residence, two guest houses, and a beach house. There are small ponds and waterfalls adorning the property around all four of the houses. These four homes take up a total area of over 16,000 square feet, which includes eight bedrooms and eleven bathrooms, combined. Additionally, the estate holds a grand total of thirteen fireplaces, two elevators, and a ten-seat private movie theater. 

The main residence makes sure its residents have full access to the picture painted by Twain, featuring massive floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the breathtaking Lake Tahoe and Sierra Nevada mountain range. 

The main home also contains a 1,700 bottle wine cellar, and its outdoor grounds feature a fire pit, hot tub, and stairs to over 500 feet worth of private lakeshore, as well as a 1,200 square foot four-car garage.
