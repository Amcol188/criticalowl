There is a fabulous home in LA's Benedict Canyon whose claim to fame isn't just its 16-acre equestrian estate; this $85 million gem was home to two of Hollywood's most iconic stars: legendary singer Cher, followed by incomparable comedian Eddie Murphy just a few years later!

Cher originally owned the multi-million dollar estate in the 1970's, when it held only four acres. She later sold it to Eddie Murphy. In the 1990s, Murphy then sold the home to its current owners, who acquired its surrounding land and redeveloped the site, adding in the equestrian amenities, two guest houses, and a tennis court. This transformation made the already formidable home on of the only equestrian estates in the entire Los Angeles area.

Located just minutes from Rodeo Drive, the compound includes a 20,000 square foot main house with 11 bedrooms and 17 baths, as well as a pool, spa, and barbecue area. The 32,000 square foot compound also counts a 7,000-square-foot guest house, two white-graveled horse rings, five stables, and idyllic riding and hiking trails that meander for miles. There's also a main stable building complete with two bedrooms, two baths, a living room, and a safe room to be enjoyed by any avid equestrians who visit the estate.

The standout 7,000-square-foot two-story guest house is designed in Moroccan style, with stunning arched windows, unique handmade tiles, and hand-carved wooden doors. It contains a master suite, two bedrooms, and six bathrooms, along with two full kitchens, a spa, and a large, open patio. This patio joins the various trails, stables, and other amenities on the property that keep it deeply rooted in nature, ensuring that its occupants enjoy both the man-made features of the property and the stunning natural wonders surrounding it.

The main house is currently being remodeled, and precise details of its layout are kept under wraps. However, if the estate's history of modification and expansion is any indication, it would be altogether easy for new owners to introduce features to the estate in order to make it fit their own vision.
