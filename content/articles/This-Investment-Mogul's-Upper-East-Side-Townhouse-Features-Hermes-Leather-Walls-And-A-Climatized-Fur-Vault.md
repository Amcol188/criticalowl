This 1903 Beaux-Arts mansion might be one of the most opulent listings in New York City. Once the fourth most expensive listing in Manhattan, the 15,000-square-foot Upper East Side residence dropped from its original 2016 listing price of $84.5 million to $79.5 million in June of last year.

The limestone townhouse is owned by Keith Rubenstein, one of the founders of the private investment firm Somerset Partners, and is kitted out with everything a New Yorker could possibly need. Spread out over six floors connected by a marble staircase and private elevator, you'll find a plunge pool, sauna, a basement spa and gym, his and her suites and a boudoir with steam-resistant mirrors, a gas fireplace, soaking tub and a cosmetics refrigerator. There's even a temperature-controlled vault for furs, and a media room on the fifth floor with walls lined in red Herm√®s leather.

Originally designed and constructed by John H. Duncan in 1903, the legendary architect of Grant's Tomb, the townhouse was extensively remodeled and decorated by designer William T. Georgis after Rubenstein purchased it in 2007 for $35 million.

The three-year renovation also included dining room flooring inspired the Pavlovsk Palace in St. Petersburg, as well as a fully decked-out, 2,500 rooftop with lounge and dining areas, an outdoor kitchen and bbq and a zen rock garden. That's not to mention the sweeping views of Central Park and the city skyline.

There's a generous selection of living spaces as well, including a master library and a ventilated smoking room with wet bar. The chef's kitchen is an entertainer's delight with Carrara marble countertops, a breakfast island bar and casual dining space.

With snow melt frost sidewalks and an address just a half block from Central Park and a block from The Pierre Hotel, who would ever want to leave?

"We like to move every now and then," Rubenstein told the Wall Street Journal. "We like projects." The Rubensteins, who are empty nesters, said they may head back to their previous stomping grounds downtown.
