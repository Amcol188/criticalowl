It takes a lot of shoe leather to scrape together a spare $90 million. But if you happen to run into that kind of success (ha-ha) and are in the market for a new home, don't miss the 26,000 square foot Woodland Manor just outside of downtown Boston.

The house (a term which, though technically true, feels like a gross understatement) was built in 2000 for Paul and Phyllis Fireman. Fireman was born and raised south of Boston in Brockton, MA and dropped out of college before working a variety of jobs. This included a tenure at a sporting goods store before Fireman's business savvy led to his acquiring the North American sales rights to Reebok in 1979. 5 years later, he bought out the brand's British parent company, taking the enterprise public the next year in 1985 and eventually selling it to Adidas in 2006 for $3.8 billion. According to the Boston Globe, Fireman's personal wealth grew by over $800 million from the deal.

Offering a lovely combination of privacy with the perks of easy city accessibility, Woodland Manor features 14Â± acres of rolling lawns, ponds, sculpted rock outcrops, and a horticultural cornucopia of specimen plantings. Sited approximately five miles from downtown Boston, this green oasis sits in between the Brookline Country Club and Putterham Meadows Golf Course.

Each of Woodland Manor's exterior and interior stones was individually hand drawn. Turf walkways and pathways meander through this luxurious landscape, and the winding driveway provides a multi-step tour through the 26,000 square foot living space and more than 5,000 square feet of Deer Island granite terraces.

"This has been our home for the last 16 years, and we've enjoyed many joyful gatherings with families and friends here," says Paul Fireman about his extraordinary estate. "We took a significant amount of time to carefully create and design a home for day-to-day living, as well as casual and formal entertaining. It has truly served as our sanctuary and we will treasure our experiences and memories of this home."

The property is marketed exclusively by Jona than P. Radford and Deborah M. Gordon, sales associates affiliated with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in New England, through the company's luxury marketing division, Coldwell Banker Previews International.
