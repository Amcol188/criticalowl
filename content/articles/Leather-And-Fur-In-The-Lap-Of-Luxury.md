This 1903 Beaux-Arts mansion might be one of the most opulent listings in New York - which, as the city with one of the highest concentrations of billionaires in the world, is no small claim. Once the fourth-most expensive listing in Manhattan, the 15,000-square-foot Upper East Side residence actually dropped from its original 2016 listing price of $84.5 million to $79.5 million in June of last year.

The limestone townhouse is owned by Keith Rubenstein, one of the founders of the private investment firm Somerset Partners, and is kitted out with everything a New Yorker could possibly need - and then some, of course. Spread out over six floors connected by a marble staircase and private elevator (which is essentially the New York City real estate equivalent of an absolute palace), you'll find a plunge pool, sauna, a basement spa and gym, his and her suites and a boudoir with steam-resistant mirrors, a gas fireplace, a soaking tub, and a cosmetics refrigerator. There's even a temperature-controlled vault for furs, as well as a media room on the fifth floor with walls lined in red Herm√®s leather (because who wants generic brand custom leather wallpaper, right?).

Originally designed and constructed in 1903 by John H. Duncan, the legendary architect of Grant's Tomb, the townhouse was extensively remodeled and decorated by acclaimed designer William T. Georgis after Rubenstein purchased it in 2007 for $35 million.

The three-year renovation process also included the installation of dining room flooring inspired the Pavlovsk Palace in St. Petersburg, as well as a fully decked-out, 2,500 rooftops complete with lounge and dining areas. The installation also introduced an outdoor kitchen and bbq and a zen rock garden to the property. That's not to mention the sweeping views of Central Park and the city skyline that was there, to begin with.

The townhouse (townmansion?) s contains a generous selection of living spaces as well, including a master library and a ventilated smoking room with wet bar. The chef's kitchen is an entertainer's delight, with Carrara marble countertops, a breakfast island bar, and a casual dining space for more "low key" privately-catered-personal-menu evenings.

There's no question that New York City provides its residents with one of the most stimulating and varied arrays of activities and pastimes in the world. However, residents of this property, with its snowmelt frost sidewalks and an address less than a block from such NYC landmarks as Central Park and The Pierre Hotel, might find it challenging to want to leave home in the first place.

"We like to move every now and then," Rubenstein told the Wall Street Journal. "We like projects." The Rubensteins, who are empty nesters, said they may head back to their previous stomping grounds downtown.
