The most expensive listing in Washington DC is a $62.95 million riverfront estate constructed by late AOL co-founder James Kimsey. This property is comprised of not only a massive mansion built by Kimsey on the banks of the Potomac River but also an adjacent Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house, which the late Mr. Kimsey is said to have specifically asked to be preserved.

Overlooking DC from the Arlington/McLean, VA side of the Potomac, the Falls House is comprised of 24,500-square feet spread over six bedrooms, living and entertaining spaces, and more. The home includes four kitchens, one of which has a loading dock for catering trucks to aid in entertaining. There are two garages: the owner's garage, which connects directly to the house, and a guest garage able to hold up to 30 cars. A wine and wet bar with a humidor, featuring a walk-in wine refrigerator, a gym just off the master suite, a massage room, and an indoor hot tub with river views round out the rest of this home's enviable amenities.

Kimsey, who served three combat tours as an Airborne Ranger and won various awards for service, including an induction into the Ranger Hall of Fame, followed up his admirable tenure in the military with a career operating bars in the Washington, DC area. In May 1983, Kimsey became a manufacturing consultant for the nearly bankrupt Control Video Corporation. He was brought in by his West Point friend Frank Caufield, an investor in the company. Within 2 years, Kimsey became CEO of the firm, which would morph from the struggling GameLine online service for the Atari 2600 video game console into AOL, a giant providing access, online content, and advertising in the early days of the Internet. Kimsey served as CEO of AOL until 1995, when Steve Case, who joined Control Video Corporation as a marketing consultant and co-founded the successor entity with Kimsey, took over the reins.

Straddling the border between McLean and Arlington on the Potomac River, Kimsey's property is down the road from the estate of Steve Case, another one of American Online's co-founders. Merrywood, the home of Mr. Case and his wife Jean, is now in contract after going on the market last year for an alleged $49.5 million. More on this house next.

Mr. Kimsey built his estate's main house after buying the property for $7.6 million in 1999, according to public records. The front of the house is limestone-clad in the Italianate style, while the riverfront facade is contemporary.
