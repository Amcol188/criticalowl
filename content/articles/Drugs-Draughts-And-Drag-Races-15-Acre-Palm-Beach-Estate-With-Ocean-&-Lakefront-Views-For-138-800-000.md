Although it is currently owned by the Ziff family, a clan of publishing moguls behind Car & Driver and PC Magazine, the Gemini estate was originally built in 1940. Its original owners were no less prestigious than the ones who currently call this ultra-mansion home: the Lamberts, a family comprised of pharmaceutical giants, eventually sold their massive beachfront estate to British politician Loel Guinness (yes, that Guinness). Be it due to its prestigious ownership history, incredible location, or sheer enormity, the home is currently up for sale for $138.8 million.

Gemini is a 15-acre ocean-to-lake estate located in Palm Beach, Florida, where it is the only home on the beach for almost a mile. Originally designed as a family compound, the estate offers a 62,200-square-foot, 12-bedroom main residence, two four-bedroom beachside cottages, the seven-bedroom guest facility "Mango House," and staff quarters comprised of four studios and apartments.

In total, there are more than 30 bedrooms, a series of formal and informal living and dining areas, a media room, libraries, offices, numerous terraces, an expansive wine cellar - oh, and not one, but two elevators

The estate is equipped with an array of recreational amenities, including a swimming pool, PGA-standard golf area, regulation tennis court, half basketball court, fitness center and spa, and an elaborate children's treehouse. It also has idyllic pathways leading directly to the ocean beach side, as well as to a dock and pier on the lakeside for activities like boating and other aquatic sports. The proximity of the Gulf Stream affords Gemini a unique microclimate, with refreshing breezes and warm waters, which have allowed for the estate to house extensive botanical gardens comprised of nearly 1,500 tropical species.

Although they bought the property for just $5 million in 1985, the Ziffs listed their massive estate over a year ago with a $195 million ask via an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate. However, the property was removed from public listing sites in April 2017.
