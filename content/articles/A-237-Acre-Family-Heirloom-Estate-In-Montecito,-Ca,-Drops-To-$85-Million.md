*Rancho San Carlos has been owned by the same family for nearly 100 years*

The magnificent Rancho San Carlos, an approx. 237-acre estate property that for nearly 100 years has been under the ownership of one family, has dropped from its original $125 million listing price to $85 million.

The sprawling hilltop Monterey Colonial manor was designed by noted architect Reginald Johnson in 1931 for Ann Gavit Jackson and her husband Charles H. Jackson Jr., an American rancher, investor and polo player. The couple were the patriarchs of a prominent philanthropic family in Santa Barbara.

The nearly 30,000 square foot main residence is set in the middle of the property, at the end of a six-tenths of a mile driveway that winds through oak trees and lemon groves. It's comprised of 30 rooms, including formal living rooms, kitchens, a library, in-law apartment and 12 bedrooms, each with their own fireplace. The complex also has 10 residential cottages, an office, producing orchards and remarkably extensive equestrian facilities.

Besides exceptional architecture and impressive historical significance, Rancho San Carlos has sweeping views of the Santa Barbara mountains and the Pacific Ocean.

According to the listing, the home is "Infused with an atmosphere of sophistication and refinement" and is "situated on two natural terraces." The formal living rooms wrap around a central courtyard, while the master and family bedroom wings sit on the upper terrace, affording "privacy, calm and exceptional views."

Perhaps the most charming feature is the secret staircase that leads you to a replica of an English pub, complete with wooden casks, an oak bar, and a stone fireplace - a nod to it's Prohibition-era build. The card room, whose walls are coated in silver foil Art Deco wallpaper, might be a close second.

Since Ann's death in 1990, the property has been maintained, but the main house hasn't been lived in full-time.

Rancho San Carlos is a veritable heirloom, which has been with the Jackson three generations. According to one of their listing agents, Harry Klob of Sotheby's, "It's almost like a small city." Klob is referring to the 10 cottages that used to house employees, a 11,250-square-foot covered riding arena, an outdoor training track, and a "small office building." Speaking for the Jackson family, he says that "everyone would like to have somebody buy it and keep it together."
