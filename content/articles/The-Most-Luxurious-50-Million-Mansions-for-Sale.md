Originally built in 1940 for the Lambert pharmaceutical family and later owned by British politician Loel Guinness, brother to the brewery founder, the Gemini estate currently owned by the Ziff family, publishing moguls who built and sold magazines like PC Magazine and Car and Driver, is up for sale for $138.8 million.

Gemini is a 15-acre ocean-to-lake estate located in Palm Beach, Florida, where it is the only home on the ocean beach for almost a mile. Designed as a family compound, the estate offers a 62,200-square-foot, 12-bedroom main residence, two four-bedroom beachside cottages, the seven-bedroom guest facility “Mango House,” and staff quarters comprised of four studios and apartments. 

In total, there are more than 30 bedrooms, a series of formal and informal living and dining areas, a media room, libraries, offices, numerous terraces, an expansive wine cellar and two elevators.

The estate has an array of recreational amenities, including a swimming pool, PGA standard golf area, regulation tennis court, half basketball court, fitness center and spa, and an elaborate children’s treehouse. It also has pathways leading to the ocean beach as well as to a dock and pier on the lake side for boating and water sports. The proximity of the Gulf Stream affords Gemini a unique microclimate, with refreshing breezes and warm waters, which have allowed for extensive botanical gardens that showcase nearly 1,500 tropical species.

The Ziffs listed the property over a year ago with a $195 million ask via an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate; however, the property came off of public listing sites in April 2017. The Ziffs bought the property through an investment consultant in 1985 for just $5 million, according to property records.

**I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE:** Asking $108 million for the 1,800 acre Las Varas Ranch, which features nearly 2 miles of pristine Santa Barbara beachfront and was built by Edward Doheny, who inspired Upton Sinclair’s Oil! and the 2007 film “There Will Be Blood” with Daniel Day-Lewis.
{{< img src="50k-3.jpg" >}}

In 1892, Doheny drilled the first successful oil well in the Los Angeles City Oil Field. His success set off a petroleum boom in Southern California, and made him a fortune. His empire eventually became the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company, one of the largest oil companies in the world in the 1920s, which in 1954 merged with Standard of Indiana to form the American Oil Company, or Amoco. Amoco was in turn acquired by British Petroleum in 1998.

In the 1920s, Doheny was implicated in the Teapot Dome Scandal and accused of offering a $100,000 bribe to United States Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. While Doheny was twice acquitted of offering the bribe, Fall was convicted of accepting it. The character J. Arnold Ross in Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil! (the inspiration for the 2007 film There Will Be Blood) is loosely based on Doheny.

A legacy of oil magnate Edward Doheny, the Las Varas Ranch is comprised of flat open pasture, live oak, eucalyptus, and juniper forests, actively farmed avocado and lemon orchards, private canyon trails stretching toward the Santa Ynez mountains, two fresh water creeks, an 18 acre reservoir, and over 10,000 feet of private access oceanfront with sandy beaches. 

Current structures include the owner's hacienda, ranch manager's cottage, Victorian era guest house, horse barn corral, mechanics cottages, and multiple outbuildings dating to 1920's. The property affords plenty of room for new construction given its ample 1,800 total acres, of which 520 are open to the Pacific Ocean.

This is the first time the property has been offered for sale in over 50 years. [Douglas Elliman](https://www.elliman.com/other/10045-calle-real-goleta-muxyrgk) Real Estate has the listing. There will be a picturesque slice of California beachfront heaven.

**YOU’VE GOT MANSIONS:** The priciest listing in Washington DC is late AOL co-founder James Kimsey’s $62.95 million riverfront estate, which features a massive home he built on the banks of the Potomac River as well as an adjacent Frank Lloyd Wright -designed house the late Mr. Kimsey is said to have wished preserved.

Overlooking Washington, DC from the Arlington / McLean, Virginia side of the Potomac, the Falls House features 24,500-square feet spread over six bedrooms, living and entertaining spaces, and more. To aid in entertaining, the house has four kitchens, one of which has a loading dock for catering trucks. There are two garages: the owner’s garage, which connects directly to the house, and a guest garage for up to 30 cars. A wine and wet bar with humidor featuring a walk-in wine refrigerator, a gym just off the master suite, a massage room, and an indoor hot tub with river views.

Kimsey, who served three combat tours as an Airborne Ranger and won various awards for service including induction into the Ranger Hall of Fame, began his career operating bars in the Washington DC area after the military. In May 1983, Kimsey became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video Corporation, which was near bankruptcy. He was brought in by his West Point friend Frank Caufield, an investor in the company. Within 2 years he was CEO of the firm, which would morph from the GameLine online service for the Atari 2600 video game console into Internet access and online content and advertising juggernaut AOL. Kimsey served as CEO of AOL until 1995, when Steve Case, who joined Control Video Corporation as a marketing consultant and co-founded the successor entity with Kimsey, took the AOL CEO reins.

Straddling the border between McLean and Arlington on the Potomac River, the property is down the road from the estate of Steve Case, another one of American Online’s co-founders. Merrywood, the home of Mr. Case and his wife Jean, is now in contract after going on the market last year for $49.5 million, according to sources with knowledge of the transaction. More on this house _next_.

Mr. Kimsey built the main house after buying the property for $7.6 million in 1999 according to public records. The front of the house is Italianate-style clad in limestone, while the riverfront facade is contemporary.

**DIALING UP ANOTHER WASHINGTON, DC MANSION:** AOL co-founder Steve Case is selling Merrywood, a childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, located just down the road from late co-founder James Kimsey for $49.5 million. The home is located in McLean, Virginia across the Potomac river from Washington, DC.

The Merrywood estate, built in 1919, has served as home to several influential political and business leaders. As the childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Merrywood was elevated to a position of prominence in the mid-1940s and has since continued to provide a celebrated venue to host presidents, business leaders, artists, and countless family celebrations.

The estate is sited on seven acres with views of the Potomac River. The Georgian-style residence features a gracious entry hall that opens to public rooms scaled to accommodate both large gatherings and intimate family occasions. The interiors are the work of designer Barry Dixon. The second floor family quarters include an expansive master suite, study and exercise room and four additional bedrooms. The lower level has a wine cellar. An elevator services all four levels of the residence.

Outside, the formal gardens are reminiscent of the timeless work of celebrated 19th and 20th Century landscape architect, Beatrix Ferrand, reflecting a series of outdoor garden rooms for large scale entertaining, intimate al fresco dining, or simply relaxing and engaging the sweeping views. Steps from the main residence, a sun-drenched pavilion provides a full kitchen, separate exercise studio, changing rooms, and an indoor pool, in addition to access to the lighted tennis court and outdoor swimming pool.

A separate carriage house provides indoor parking for four automobiles, an estate office, security office, and accommodations for staff. The entire property is gated, fenced, and protected by a state-of-the-art security system. Throughout, the estate has been impeccably maintained, and the systems and technology are the finest available.

Unquestionably, Merrywood is the finest private estate in the Washington, DC region.  Except for Seth's house.

Merrywood is listed by TTR Sotheby's International Realty and JLL. For additional information please contact Mark C. Lowham, CEO and Managing Partner and Juliana E. May, Senior Vice President.
