From Wall Street titans and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, to oil sheikhs and oligarchs; the well-off have a propensity for dropping millions to obtain one of these dazzling, floating palaces.

While luxury doesn’t come cheap, these jaw-dropping yachts feature everything from exquisite staterooms, theatres and helipads, to one-of-a-kind additions like barber shops, concert-halls and even a rumored missile defense system. Because you never know when your Doctor Evil-inspired plan to “just do what we always do, hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage” will catch up with you.

Fuel your daydreams with this exclusive peek below deck on four of the sleekest mega-yachts recently on the market. All aboard!

The brand new, 361-foot superyacht known as Jubilee was originally built for the former Emir of Qatar, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, who passed away before the boat’s maiden voyage last year. Already in the history books, Jubilee was the largest yacht ever constructed in the Netherlands and can host 30 guests in its 15 luxurious cabins, including four VIP cabins. Other breathtaking features include a built-in aquarium on the pool deck, a stunning 1,453 square foot lounge, a private owner’s deck and extraordinary craftsmanship on both the interior and exterior walls. Not to mention, plenty of room for all the toys including a helipad, three tender superyachts and two rescue superyachts. This beauty can be all yours for just $310 million dollars, or 15.5 million easy payments of $19.95.

## Elements

The story behind this elegant 262-foot superyacht is more unique than most. When the person who originally commissioned Elements suddenly withdrew, the owner of Yachtley, the Turkish shipyard building the ship, made a bold decision to invest in his craftspeople and fund the completion of the yacht himself. The decision turned out to be a good one. Renowned Italian designer Christiano Gatto joined the team and transformed the interior into an elaborate masterpiece. Elements reaches an impressive 17-knot cruising speed and features cushy accommodations for 24 guests in 12 staterooms. And there’s a few extra perks on-board including a Turkish bath and sauna on the beach deck, a garage for jet-skis and an even elevator to transport guests between the main and bridge decks.
