Hollywood film producer Thomas Tull, whose production resume includes the blockbuster films The Dark Knight, Jurassic World, and 300, listed his 50,000 square foot home in Thousand Oaks, CA for $85 million. The price tag may not even touch the budgets of some of his more popular films, but it's pretty hefty all the same.

Tull's estate, which stands to set records in the Thousand Oaks market, includes a 32,000-square-foot main house with stunning 360-degree views of the surrounding area, a 2,6000-square-foot pool house with day spa, an 11,000-square-foot guest house, and a 4,200-square-foot ranch house.

The estate boasts an incredible total of 12 bedrooms and 18 full baths spread out across the four separate homes, including a 5,000-square-foot master suite.

In a 2015 interview with Acorn, Tull expressed what he valued most about living in Thousand Oaks. "We love the community," he said. "We think the aesthetics are just beautiful, the rolling hills that are sometimes green after a rainstorm. I really wanted to live in a place that felt like a community."

Since Tull and his wife, Alba, acquired the estate in 2011, they've reimagined it from the ground up. Prior to their purchase of it, the estate was actually a cul de sac comprised of three separate single-family homes. Seeing the area's potential, Tull applied to have it turned into one private property. After seven years of construction and renovations - including the addition of a basketball court, full Dolby-digital theater, photo studio, playground, two swimming pools, a manicured garden inspired by Monet's gardens in France, and a five-acre organic garden with greenhouse - the family finally moved into their dream estate.

Tull, who is also part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, noted that the property's quarter-acre lake was his favorite amenity, as it reminded him of his east-coast roots.

"It's a great place to go down and reflect," Tull said in an interview. "At some point in my life, I saw something very similar in the Northeast, where there was a pond with a water wheel. It's just really tranquil. It was a vision that came from younger days."

Tull, who sold his production company Legendary Entertainment in 2016 for $3.5 billion, is reportedly moving to a farm he bought outside of Pittsburgh last year.
