**This Thousand Oaks compound features four homes, an organic farm and two swimming pools.**

Hollywood film producer Thomas Tull, famous for his financial roles in films like the Dark Knight trilogy, Jurassic World and 300, listed his 50,000 square foot state home in Thousand Oaks, CA for $85 million.

Tull's estate, which stands to set records in the Thousand Oaks market, includes a 32,000 square-foot main house with stunning 360 degree views, a 2,6000 square foot pool house with day spa, an 11,000-square-foot guest house and a 4,200-square-foot ranch house.

 In total, the estate has 12 bedrooms and 18 full baths spread out across the four separate homes, including a 5,000 square foot master suite.

In his 2015 Acorn interview, Tull expressed what he valued about living in Thousand Oaks.

"We love the community,” said Tull of living in Thousand Oaks, during in a 2015 interview with Acorn. "We think the aesthetics are just beautiful, the rolling hills that are sometimes green after a rainstorm. I really wanted to live in a place that felt like a community.”

Since Tull and his wife, Alba, acquired the estate in 2011, they've reimagined it from the ground up. Previously, the estate was three different single-family homes on the same cul-de-sac, which Tull applied to have turned private. After seven years of building and renovations, that included the addition of a basketball court, full Dolby-digital theater, photo studio, playground two swimming pools, a manicured garden inspired by Monet's gardens in France, and a five acre organic garden with greenhouse, the family finally moved in.

Tull, who is also part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, noted that his personal favorite amenity - a quarter-acre lake - reminds him of his east-coast roots.

"It’s a great place to go down and reflect,” Tull said in an interview. "At some point in my life, I saw something very similar in the Northeast, where there was a pond with a water wheel. It’s just really tranquil. It was a vision that came from younger days."

Tull, who sold his production company Legendary Entertainment in 2016 for $3.5 billion, is reportedly moving to a farm he bought outside Pittsburgh last year.
