The lavish Palazzo di Amore is back on the market after a near-15% price cut. Once upon a time in La La Land, this 35,000-square-foot estate in Beverly Hills was the most expensive home listed in the U.S., at an extraordinary $195 million. Since then, the home has been removed from listing and repriced five different times. Real estate billionaire Jeff Greene, who purchased the property for a reported $35 million in 2007 and spent the subsequent seven years renovating it, has again dropped the price on his prestigious estate. The Palazzo di Amore is now available to a comparably lower (but still shock-inducing) $129 million.

Located about seven minutes by car from the legendary Rodeo Drive, the Palazzo di Amore sits on a 25-acre lot with panoramic city-to-ocean views. The estate consists of a 35,000-square-foot main home, a 15,000-square-foot entertainment center, and a separate guest home, making up a grand total of 12 bedrooms and 23 bathrooms in 53,000 livable square feet.

The property also features a waterfall, luxurious gardens, a wine-tasting room, a 10,000-bottle wine storage cellar, and a Turkish-style spa. As a true treat for viticulturalists, the property even has its own working vineyard on site, which produces between 350 and 500 cases a year of six varietals: Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Rose, and Sauvignon Blanc.

Greene, who according to Forbes is worth $3 billion, purchased the home out of bankruptcy from a Middle Eastern businessman and his wife. He then hired mega-mansion builder Mohamed Hadid to work on the design. This endeavor required a huge amount creativity and skill from planning to execution, as the nature of the home's sale meant that a deed was given, but no architectural plans. Greene also employed architect Bob Ray Offenhauser and designer Alberto Pinto to work on the project, although both Greene and his wife took on the majority of the decision making.

Greene himself has no explanation for why construction was such an extensive process. "I have no logical explanation for why we spent the next seven-and-a-half years building this house," he said in an interview with Forbes. However, the intricacy of the detailing incorporated into the home may have been a part of it - in fact, according to the same interview, Greene at one point commissioned a Peruvian woodcarver to hand-carve fireplace mantels for four months on-site.

Despite, or maybe because of, the long-term nature of the process, Greene takes it all in stride: "That's the world of building very detailed custom homes."
