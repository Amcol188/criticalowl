The 35,000 square foot mansion Palazzo di Amore features took over seven years to renovate 

The lavish Palazzo di Amore is back on the market after a nearly 15% price cut. Once upon a time, this 35,000-square-foot estate in Beverly Hills was the most expensive home listed in the U.S., at $195 million. Now, after being removed from listing and repriced five different times, real estate billionaire Jeff Greene, who purchased the property for a reported $35 million in 2007 and spent the subsequent seven years renovating it, has again dropped the price on his prestigious estate. The Palazzo di Amore is now available to for just $129 million. 

Located about seven minutes by car from Rodeo Drive, the Palazzo di Amore sits on a 25 acre lot with panoramic city-to-ocean views. The estate consists of a 35,000-square-foot main home, a 15,000-square-foot entertainment center and a separate guest home, making up a total of 12 bedrooms and 23 bathrooms in 53,000 livable square feet. 

It also features a waterfall, luxurious gardens, a wine tasting room, 10,000 bottle wine storage cellar and a Turkish-style spa. As a true treat for viticulturalists, the property even has its own working vineyard on site, which produces between 350 and 500 cases a year of six varietals: Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Rose, and Sauvignon Blanc. 


Greene, who according to Forbes is worth $3 billion, purchased the home out of bankruptcy from a Middle Eastern businessman and his wife. He then hired mega-mansion builder Mohamed Hadid to work on the design, which required a lot of creativity as the bankruptcy sale involved a deed but no house plans. He also employed architect Bob Ray Offenhauser and designer Alberto Pinto, although both Greene and his wife remained involved in the majority of the decision making.

Greene himself has no explanation for why building was so drawn out. "I have no logical explanation for why we spent the next seven-and-a-half years building this house," he said in an interview with Forbes. According to the same interview, he at one point had a Peruvian woodcarver was on site for four months to hand-carve the fireplace mantels.

Green takes it all in stride. "That's the world of building very detailed custom homes."
