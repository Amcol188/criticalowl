Rancho San Carlos has been owned by the same family for nearly 100 years.

The magnificent Rancho San Carlos, an estate spanning across an approximate 237 acres, has dropped from its original $125 million listing price to $85 million after a near 100 years under the ownership of the same family.

The sprawling hilltop Monterey Colonial manor was designed by renowned architect Reginald Johnson in 1931 for Ann Gavit Jackson and her husband Charles H. Jackson Jr., an American rancher, investor, and polo player. The couple was the figureheads of a prominent philanthropic family based in Santa Barbara.

The nearly 30,000 square foot main residence sits right in the middle of the massive property, at the end of a driveway that winds through oak trees and lemon groves for over half a mile. The main house is comprised of 30 rooms, including formal living rooms, kitchens, a library, an in-law apartment, and 12 bedrooms - each with their own fireplace. The complex also includes 10 residential cottages, an office, producing orchards, and remarkably extensive equestrian facilities.

Along with its exceptional architecture and impressive historical significance, Rancho San Carlos has sweeping views of the Santa Barbara mountains and the Pacific Ocean.

According to its listing, the home is "infused with an atmosphere of sophistication and refinement" and is "situated on two natural terraces." The formal living rooms wrap around a central courtyard, while the master and family bedroom wings sit on the upper terrace, affording "privacy, calm and exceptional views."

Perhaps the estate's most charming feature is its secret staircase, that leads occupants to a quaint replica of an English pub complete with wooden casks, an oak bar, and a stone fireplace. Aside from being a hidden gem in an already formidable treasure chest of a property, this pub is an undeniable nod to the estate's Prohibition-era construction. The estate's card room, with walls coated in silver foil Art Deco wallpaper, comprises yet another homage to the property's rich history and flair for the original.

Since Ann's death in 1990, the property has been carefully maintained, but the main house has not held any full-time residents.

Rancho San Carlos is a veritable heirloom cherished by the Jackson family for three generations. According to one of their listing agents, Harry Klob of Sotheby's, "It's almost like a small city." Klob is referring to the estate's extensive grounds and living quarters, including 10 cottages that used to house employees, an 11,250-square-foot covered riding arena, an outdoor training track, and a "small office building." Speaking for the Jackson family, he says that "everyone would like to have somebody buy it and keep it together." A home with such extraordinary features would be enough of a prize for any preeminent real-estate investor; however, its unique hidden amenities, historically significant features, and carefully thought out.
