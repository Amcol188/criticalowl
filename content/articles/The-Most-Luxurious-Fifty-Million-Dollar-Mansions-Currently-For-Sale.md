## DRUGS, DRAUGHTS, AND DRAG RACES: 15 ACRE PALM BEACH ESTATE WITH OCEAN & LAKEFRONT VIEWS FOR $138,800,000
Built in 1940, the mega-mansion known as the Gemini estate has had a few reputable owners, the most notable of whom was British politician Loel Guinness (yes, that British Guinness). 



The estate is located in Palm Beach, FL and contains about a mile of two-sided private aquatic access, with the Atlantic ocean on one side and a lake on the other. 

{{< img src="house-2.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}


The estate itself contains a 62,000-square-foot, 12-bedroom main residence. 

{{< img src="house-3.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

It also contains  two four-bedroom beachside cottages, the seven-bedroom guest facility “Mango House,” and staff quarters.

{{< img src="house-4.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate, though not found on public listings, is currently on the market for a cool $138.8 million and is jam-packed with an insane array of amenities. 

{{< img src="house-5.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

{{< img src="house-6.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}
Gemini contains a comprehensive library…

{{< img src="house-7.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Beautiful wine cellar...

{{< img src="house-8.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And stunning balconies opening onto the shoreline, giving owners a breath of fresh, salty air every morning. 

{{< img src="house-9.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Gemini’s oceanfront views make it one of the most coveted properties in all of Florida, if not the United States. 

{{< img src="house-10.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate’s massive pool area features backlit dancing waters (because the surrounding scenery wasn’t stunning enough). 

{{< img src="house-11.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

It comes equipped with amenities to suit athletes of varied backgrounds, featuring a regulation-sized gold course…

{{< img src="house-12.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

A championship-sized tennis court…

{{< img src="house-13.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And a half-court of basketball. 

{{< img src="house-14.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Gemini comes equipped with over 5,000 feet of private beach, giving residents unbreached access to the Atlantic sea. 

{{< img src="house-15.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And, on the other side, an equally private deck with access to a massive lake, allowing owners to engage in as many water sports as they’d like. You know - if the million
 in-house athletic facilities turn out not to be enough. 

{{< img src="house-16.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

With a stunning surrounding environment and beautifully constructed residences, it’s no wonder the Gemini estate is one of the most coveted properties in the United States.

## ASKING $85 MILLION IN SANTA BARBARA: THERE WILL BE BIDS

Daniel Day-Lewis fans might be interested in learning that the Las Varas Ranch, the real-life inspiration for There Will Be Blood and Upton Sinclair’s Oil!, is up for sale. 

{{< img src="house-25.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Coming in with a hefty $80 million price tag, the estate contains over two miles of private California beach. 

{{< img src="house-18.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

It includes an owner's hacienda, ranch manager's cottage, Victorian-era guest house, horse barn corral, mechanics cottages, and multiple outbuildings dating back to the 1920's.

{{< img src="house-19.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The property hasn’t been for sale in over 50 years.

{{< img src="house-20.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And, despite its incredible views and amenities, Las Varas has steadily dropped in price since its original $200 million listing. 

{{< img src="house-21.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Regardless, there’s no denying that it’s both an artistic and structural gem.

{{< img src="house-22.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate also contains actively farmed avocado and lemon orchards, fresh water creeks, an 18-acre reservoir, and private canyon trails to the Santa Ynez mountains. 

{{< img src="house-23.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Both a historical relic and artistic icon, The Las Varas Ranch is much more than an estate - and is definitely priced accordingly. 

{{< img src="house-24.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## YOU’VE GOT MANSIONS

{{< img src="house-26.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate offers stunning views of the Potomac River. 

{{< img src="house-27.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The Falls was built by James Kimsey, the late co-founder of AOL, in 1999 and is comprised of 24,500-square feet spread over six bedrooms, living and entertaining spaces, and more.

{{< img src="house-28.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

As far as amenities go, the estate is completely decked out. 

{{< img src="house-29.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Some of its residential features include a beautiful library,  a gym just off the master suite, and a massage room. 

{{< img src="house-30.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The Falls also contains an enviable wine and wet bar decked out with luxurious decor. 

{{< img src="house-31.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The Falls House also includes a pool and outdoor spa, as well as an indoor hot tub with river views to round out the rest of this home’s enviable amenities.

{{< img src="house-32.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

It also comes complete with two garages able to hold a combined 30 cars.

{{< img src="house-33.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And its regulation-sized tennis court certainly doesn’t hurt. 

{{< img src="house-34.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate’s many expansive floor to ceiling windows allow for unobstructed views of the beautiful natural landmarks surrounding the Potomac, making it an undoubtable gem of the American Northeast. 

## DIALING UP ANOTHER WASHINGTON, DC MANSION

Owned by Kimsey’s AOL colleague Steve Case, the Merrywood estate was once home to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and is currently on the market for $49.5 million. 

{{< img src="house-35.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

In the 1940’s, Merrywood rose to social prominence and has since become a gathering place for America’s political, business, and entertainment elite. The estate, spanning over seven acres on the Potomac river, was built in the Georgian style, seemingly with the social gatherings that made it famous in mind. 

{{< img src="house-36.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Merrywood is a consummate home, including an expansive master suite, study and exercise rooms, and four additional bedrooms, as well as a service elevator and wine cellar. 

{{< img src="house-37.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

{{< img src="house-38.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Carrying its rich history into present-day significance, Merrywood is an ideal home for those wishing to mold a rich and longstanding legacy with their own. 

{{< img src="house-39.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## THE WHOLE WORLD IN YOUR HANDS- ER, HOUSE 

Twain called Lake Tahoe the ‘fairest picture the whole world affords.’ For a cool $75 million, the fairest home on this already picturesque lake can be yours.

{{< img src="house-40.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Crystal Pointe was built in 1997 by Wall Street bigwig Jack Dreyfus, father to actress Julia Louis Dreyfus.

{{< img src="house-41.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The property  is nestled in the idyllic Tahoe forest and includes a main residence, two guest houses, and a beach house, taking up a total of 16,000 square feet. 

{{< img src="house-42.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Additionally, the estate includes massive floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the breathtaking Lake Tahoe and Sierra Nevada mountain range.

{{< img src="house-43.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

It also holds a grand total of are thirteen fireplaces, two elevators, and a ten-seat private movie theater.

{{< img src="house-44.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Though its views are, as Twain hinted, some of the most coveted in the world, Crystal Pointe’s interior is comparably stunning. 

{{< img src="house-45.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

With intricate chandeliers, handmade detailing, and ceaseless windows into the “fairest picture” in the world, the estate holds an undeniable sense of grandeur. 

{{< img src="house-46.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The property’s amenities, like its cozy library with one-of-a-kind fireplace, are not to be overlooked. 

{{< img src="house-47.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate’s four homes contain a combined total of eight bedrooms and eleven bathrooms. 

{{< img src="house-48.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}
 
The main home alone holds a 1,700 bottle wine cellar, and its outdoor grounds feature a fire pit, hot tub, and stairs to over 500 feet worth of private lake shore, as well as a 1,200 square foot four-car garage.

{{< img src="house-49.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The combination of the estate’s amenities and incredibly spacious residential rooms has rendered it the most expensive home on the Tahoe market since it was built. 

{{< img src="house-50.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And let’s not forget the in-house movie theater, of course. 

{{< img src="house-51.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Placed on the market in July 2017, the Tahoe gem has attracted widespread attention and interest - though it remains on sale. 

{{< img src="house-52.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

With breathtaking views, incomparable amenities, and one of the most coveted addresses in the world, this property’s huge price tag almost feels justified - almost. 

{{< img src="house-53.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}


## PUTTING THE “MANY” IN “AMENITIES” 
When  a luxury homeowner’s imagination and net worth intersect, the result can be  more insane amenities than even the most ambitious entertainment junkies can enjoy. Four Peaks Ranch is such a case.

{{< img src="house-54.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

These incredible amenities include an indoor/outdoor pool with planetarium-style roof over the indoor section depicting star-filled night sky.

{{< img src="house-55.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Views of Mt. Sopris, Mt. Daly, Capital Peak and Snowmass.

{{< img src="house-56.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And spacious grounds complete with a lounge area set to incomparable sights, 

{{< img src="house-57.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate’s main residence is an 18,000-square-foot home with 7 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. 

{{< img src="house-58.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

But back to the amenities and features, which also comprise a private beach with waterfall cascading through three separate swimming ponds...

{{< img src="house-58.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And panoramic views of the breathtaking surrounding area.  

{{< img src="house-60.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Its wood and brick detailing render the property both luxurious and cozy. 

{{< img src="house-61.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And the  movie theater room with small stage for karaoke/jam banding can’t hurt, either.

{{< img src="house-62.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The Four Peaks property comprises an additional furnished teepee with gas heat, 876 acres with 15 miles of trails for horseback riding or ATVing, golf-course, wine cellar, and countless more amenities. 

{{< img src="house-63.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Like the comprehensive in-house fitness center. 

{{< img src="house-64.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And spa-style bathrooms complete with rainfall showerheads. 

{{< img src="house-65.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

These structures combine to make Four Peaks one of the most sought-after properties in the world. 

{{< img src="house-66.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The coveted nature of the estate probably contributes to its $58.5 million price tag. 

{{< img src="house-67.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Four Peaks’ boundless features are enough to make residents and guests never want to leave. With intoxicating views and incredible amenities, it’s truly the best of both worlds.

## IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING: REEBOK BILLIONAIRE’S $90 MILLION BOSTON MEGA ESTATE

{{< img src="house-73.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

{{< img src="house-74.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## WHAT DO CHER & EDDIE MURPHY HAVE IN COMMON? THIS $85MM HOME

This fabulous $85 million estate, located in LA’s Benedict Canyon, is absolutely one of a kind in more ways than one. 

{{< img src="house-75.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

In addition to its massive structure and insane features, the property was home to not one, but two Hollywood icons: Cher, then Eddie Murphy. 

{{< img src="house-76.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate contains a 20,000 square foot main house with 11 bedrooms and 17 baths, a pool and spa, two horse rings, five stables, and hiking trails that go on for miles. 

{{< img src="house-77.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Murphy put his personal touch on the home. two guest houses and a tennis court on the grounds…

{{< img src="house-78.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

He also had sophisticated stables installed, 

{{< img src="house-79.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Complete with comprehensive equestrian amenities that would make his iconic character, Donkey from Shrek, perfectly at home. 

{{< img src="house-80.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate’s guest house is a formidable sight, as well, spanning over 7,000 square feet and built in the Moroccan style with handmade custom detailing. 

{{< img src="house-81.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

As was highlighted by Murphy’s additions, the estate is constantly undergoing expansions and remodeling efforts. Because of this, exact details of its updated layout are unknown. 

{{< img src="house-82.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Regardless of the specifics, this estate’s glamorous occupants and incredible amenities make it one of L.A’s finest properties. 

{{< img src="house-83.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## LEATHER AND FUR IN THE LAP OF LUXURY 

Once the fourth-most expensive listing in Manhattan, the 15,000-square-foot Upper East Side residence dropped from its 2016 listing price of $84.5 million to $79.5 million in June 2017. 

{{< img src="house-84.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Spread out over six floors, this opulent estate is connected by a marble staircase and private elevator. 

{{< img src="house-85.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The townhouse (er- townmansion?) has a facade clad in limestone and interiors designed by architect John H. Duncan, the legendary mastermind behind Grant’s tomb. 

{{< img src="house-86.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The home underwent a three-year renovation process in 2007. During this time, its owner used the Pavlovsk Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia, as inspiration for the elaborate dining room flooring. 

{{< img src="house-87.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

This property boasts one of the most sought-after addresses in New York City, sitting less than a block from the Pierre Hotel and Central Park. 

{{< img src="house-88.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

This New York novelty contains a generous selection of living spaces as well, including a master library and a ventilated smoking room with wet bar.

{{< img src="house-89.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The townhouse is filled with curiosities, not the least of which is its massive, New York City-defying kitchen. 

{{< img src="house-90.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The spaciousness extends throughout the home, from its massive rooms to a fully decked-out, 2,500 rooftop complete with with lounge and dining areas, outdoor kitchen and bbq, and zen rock garden. 

{{< img src="house-91.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

“Bathroom” is, apparently, for mere peasants. Instead, this home comes equipped with  a boudoir with steam-resistant mirrors, a gas fireplace, a soaking tub, and a cosmetics refrigerator. 

{{< img src="house-92.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Though elusive of photographs, two of this estate’s most opulent features have generated most of its buzz: a temperature-controlled vault for furs and a media room on the fifth floor with walls lined in red Hermès leather (because who wants generic brand custom leather wallpaper, right?).

{{< img src="house-93.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Though few features are as grand as custom Hermes leather wallpaper, the private gym - a feature relatively unheard of in overcrowded NYC - certainly solidifies this property’s hefty price tag. 

{{< img src="house-94.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And its private plunge pool, sauna, and basement spa probably aren’t doing a potential price decrease any favors. 

{{< img src="house-95.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The combination of eclectic amenities, masterful architecture, and enviable location render this one-of-a-kind townhouse an incomparable gem in a city already full of novelties. 

## NEW YORK’S LARGEST ORIGINAL APARTMENT ON FIFTH AVENUE HITS THE MARKET

After several dips in pricing, the 12,000-square-foot Fifth Avenue duplex that was once the most expensive apartment in New York City has “settled” into its current $76-million-dollar listing.

{{< img src="house-97.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Spread across the 7th and 8th floors of a famous Fifth Avenue Co-op this apartment features 20 different rooms, each of which epitomizes classic New York luxury. 

{{< img src="house-98.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The apartment (or, better yet mansion in a high-rise)’s 20 rooms encompass an array of residential and entertaining amenities, including a library, wine cellar, two fireplaces, den/smoking room with wet bar, and a dumbwaiter to the first-floor kitchen (which is decked out with massive pantries!). 

{{< img src="house-99.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The entryway is designed to be immediately triking, featuring a grand marcle entry staircase. 

{{< img src="house-100.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

In a city rife with windowless rooms and brick-building-next-door views, this property is one of a kind due to being imbued with extensive natural light.

{{< img src="house-101.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

It also features what is arguably the most sought-after view in the world: unobstructed sight of the iconic Central Park. 

{{< img src="house-102.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Finding an intersection between modern convenience and timeless opulence, this apartment displays an extraordinary elegance that is every bit as undeniable and unique as that of New York City.

{{< img src="house-103.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## ONCE AMERICA’S MOST EXPENSIVE HOME, THIS OPULENT BEVERLY HILLS MANSION IS BACK ON THE MARKET

Once upon a time in the City of Angels, the lavish, 35,000-square-foot Palazzo di Amore in Beverly Hills was the most expensive home listed in the U.S. 

{{< img src="house-105.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Now, after five re-pricings, the home is listed at $129 million (yeah - believe it or not, that’s the ultra-reduced price). 

{{< img src="house-107.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate features extensive and luxurious gardens, including a long rectangular pool that is evocative of the incomparably opulent Palace of Versailles. 

{{< img src="house-108.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Consisting of a massive main home, entertainment center, Turkish-style spa, and guest home, this property sprawls across 53,000 livable square feet. 

{{< img src="house-109.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The intricately detailed home took over seven years to build. In fact, a woodcarver was at one point flown in from Peru to hand-carve the home’s fireplace mantels.

{{< img src="house-110.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The Palazzo contains not just a 10,000-bottle wine storage cellar, and an entire dedicated wine-tasting room, but its own vineyard, which produces between 350 and 500 bottles of wine annually. 

{{< img src="house-111.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The home was purchased in 2007 by real estate billionaire Jeff Greene, who commissioned master mega-mansion builder Mohamed Hadid to expand and renovate the home. This was a particularly daunting task - even for him - because no blueprints were provided to Greene when the Palazzo was sold to him. 

{{< img src="house-112.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Greene and Hadid’s massive renovation took over seven and a half years to complete. When asked about it, Greene claimed he “had no logical explanation” as to why the project took so long. 

{{< img src="house-113.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

From the estate’s sheer enormity to the masterful artistry committed to its expansion, the Palazzo di Amore’s nine-figure price tag makes slightly more sense. Slightly. 

{{< img src="house-114.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## SECRET STAIRCASES AND SWEEPING SITES: AN $85 MILLION DREAM

1.5: After being owned by the same family for over 100 years, the magnificent Rancho San Carlos has not only gone on the market, but dropped in pricing from $125 million to just (just!) $85 million.

{{< img src="house-115.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}
 
Designed by acclaimed architect Reginald Johnson, the Monterey Colonial manor was constructed on an idyllic hilltop in 1931. 

{{< img src="house-116.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The property’s main residence alone is comprised of 12 bedrooms (each with its own fireplace).

{{< img src="house-117.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The overall complex contains 10 residential cottages, an office, and producing orchards, among other features. 

{{< img src="house-118.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

According to its listing, the home is "infused with an atmosphere of sophistication and refinement" and is "situated on two natural terraces."

{{< img src="house-119.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The master and family bedroom wings sit on the upper terrace. This allows for privacy without sacrificing the property’s stunning views. 

{{< img src="house-120.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate’s extensive grounds and living quarters, including 10 cottages that used to house employees, a 11,250-square-foot covered riding arena, an outdoor training track, and a "small office building."

{{< img src="house-121.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

By far, this property’s most charming feature is a hidden staircase to a quaint replica of an English pub, complete with wooden casks, an oak bar, and a stone fireplace.

{{< img src="house-122.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Though less unique than the pub, its other features are not to be overlooked. These include an indoor tennis court, Art Deco-style card room, and a beautiful central courtyard. 

{{< img src="house-123.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate contains over a half mile of oak trees and lemon groves leading to its magnificent 30,000-square-foot main residence. 

{{< img src="house-124.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Monterrey Colonial manor also comprises its own array of extensive equestrian facilities. This includes a state of the art stable.

{{< img src="house-125.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

A riding pen makes up another component of the property’s equestrian features.

{{< img src="house-126.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And these are rounded out with open fields for horses to run. These, and the Monterrey Colonial Manor’s other incomparable features, render it a paradise for owners who characterize themselves as paradoxically restless homebodies. 

{{< img src="house-127.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

## TALK ABOUT PRODUCTION VALUE: LEGENDARY PRODUCER’S HOME LISTED AT $85 MILLION

Hollywood film producer Thomas Tull, who is behind blockbusters like The Dark Knight and 300, listed his 50,000-square-foot Thousand Oaks, CA home for $85 million. 

{{< img src="house-128.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The estate is endowed with some insane structures, including a 32,000-square-foot main house.

{{< img src="house-129.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

In addition to the main house, the estate contains three additional properties totaling in over 15,000 square feet.

{{< img src="house-130.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Overall, Tull’s estate contains 12 bedrooms and 18 bathrooms. 

{{< img src="house-131.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

In a 2015 interview, Tull cited the community and aesthetics as the reasons behind his family’s chosen setting for their estate. 

{{< img src="house-132.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And aesthetics are a major component of this enormous property, which spans over what was originally a cul de sac comprised of three separate family homes. 

{{< img src="house-133.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

{{< img src="house-134.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Tull says his estate is a “great place to go down and reflect,” citing its tranquility as one of its major qualities. The massive, cozy library installed on-site by Tull probably does wonders for the property’s sense of escapism. 

{{< img src="house-135.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Overall, Tull’s renovations and construction on the estate took over seven years to complete. 

{{< img src="house-136.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

And its breathtakingly opulent rooms, each displaying an extraordinary sense of detail in architecture and design, are testament to the amount of effort placed into construction efforts on this home. 

{{< img src="house-137.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

True to form as a Hollywood producer, Tull had a beautiful full Dolby home movie theater installed

{{< img src="house-138.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

The property also features an underground wine cellar, complete with full dining table and spacious seating areas. 

{{< img src="house-139.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Oh- and a master suite several times bigger than most apartments at 5,000 square feet. 

{{< img src="house-140.jpg" caption="Via Sotheby's" >}}

Each of the property’s 18 bathrooms is individually decorated in precise (and lavish) detail.

And its larger suites aren’t so simple as to be limited to just one bedroom: they span across various private halls, rooms, and closet spaces.

To a simple observer, the closets might be mistaken for bedrooms (or studio apartments).

In addition to the grand main house, Tull’s estate is comprised of guest, pool, and ranch houses.

Perhaps as an occupational hazard, Tull has enjoyed incorporating different themes into each of his main house’s rooms,

Making each one equally unique and downright fun.

Not to mention draped in priceless athletic memorabilia. Though these will leave the property with Tull, they will leave behind spaces that can be decorated to the highest extents of their occupants’ imaginations.

The estate’s features are by no means limited to the insane movie theaters: they also include a huge fitness center that rivals most gym franchises around the country.

Tull’s upcoming relocation to Pittsburgh will leave this stunning estate up for grabs to the highest bidder.

Meaning that all of its structures, including the 2,600-square-foot pool house and day spa, will be enjoyed by another lucky owner.

And its guest house, rivaling most California mansions at an 11,000 square feet, will continue housing various (undoubtedly stunned) visitors for years to come.

Perhaps one of the greatest gems installed by Tull into his estate is the professional photo studio.

As well as its five-acre organic garden and greenhouse.

The estate’s gardens are inspired by Monet’s greenery in France.

And its convertible basketball-tennis court can keep any number of its occupants busy for hours on end.

In true California fashion, Tull remodeled his estate with environmentalism in mind, installing solar panels to power the massive amounts of technology and utilities throughout.

Its swimming pools (both of them) invoke the tranquility that Tull cites as one of his favorite elements about this property.

And they offer views of the estate’s stunning gardens.

The estate’s main house offers 360-degree views of the surrounding area, which includes a quaint pond and waterfront cottage.

As well as ceaseless greenery providing a Secret Garden-esque sense of escape.

“Decked out” doesn’t begin to describe Tull’s property. Its grandeur, opulence, and attention to detail are as much a testament to Tull’s masterful eye as his various blockbuster films.
