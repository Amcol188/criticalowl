The average passenger can't afford to fly first-class, let alone buy a ~$60 million private jet like the Gulfstream G550 or Bombardier Global. However, there is a market for these expensive jets, and there are a select few who can afford more than that. Those wealthy travelers are converting commercial airliners into flying palaces that can cost upwards of $400 million. Here is a brief glimpse into the world of “VVIP” private air travel. Warning: after seeing these images, returning to seat 29E by the lavatory, right behind someone’s howling child might not be the same.

## 2014 BOEING BBJ

## 2010 AIRBUS AC318 ELITE
The Airbus A318 may be the smallest member of the A320 family of planes, but this particular luxury liner is partial to creature comfort. A new A318 would cost ~$77 million without the interior work. This AC318 accommodates 19 VIPs plus a full crew. It has two cabins plus a stateroom, three bathrooms and a full galley. It is being brokered by Global Jet Elite in Monaco.

## SEAT 29E
And now, for a dose of polite commercial and small private airplane bathroom humor to bring you back to reality.

This creatively-written tail of woe, penned en-flight by an understandably aggrieved passenger pushed beyond his or her limit, was received by United Airlines-predecessor Continental Airlines in April 2005 and has been verified as authentic.
