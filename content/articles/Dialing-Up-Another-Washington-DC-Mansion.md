AOL co-founder Steve Case is selling Merrywood, his own jaw-dropping estate, for or $49.5 million. Though its asking price rests on the "lower" end of the homes listed here, Merrywood is by no means lacking in grandeur: a childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, this mansion is located just down the road from that of AOL's other co-founder, the late James Kimsey. The home is located in McLean, Virginia across the Potomac River from Washington, DC.

Since its construction in 1919, the Merrywood estate has served as home to several influential political and business leaders. As the childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Merrywood came into the spotlight beginning in the mid-1940s, and it has since continued to function as a political gathering point of sorts, becoming a celebrated venue to host presidents, business leaders, artists, and countless Kennedy family celebrations.

The estate spans over seven acres with views of the Potomac River. The Georgian-style residence seems to have been perfectly built for the social gatherings which have made it famous: Merrywood features a gracious entry hall that opens to public rooms scaled to accommodate anything from large celebrations to intimate family gatherings. The interiors are the work of designer Barry Dixon. The second-floor family quarters include an expansive master suite, study and exercise rooms, and four additional bedrooms. An elevator services all four levels of the residence, including its elaborate lower-level wine cellar.

Outside, Merrywood's formal gardens are reminiscent of the timeless work of celebrated 19th- and 20th-century landscape architect Beatrix Ferrand. The gardens are surrounded by a series of stunning outdoor rooms for meant for a range of social activities, including large-scale entertaining, intimate al fresco dining, or simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking views. Just steps away from the main residence, a sun-drenched pavilion provides a full kitchen, separate exercise studio, changing rooms, and an indoor pool, in addition to access to the lighted tennis court and outdoor swimming pool that comprise the rest of the estate's recreational facilities.

The combination of Merrywood's lavish features and sweeping history render security a top priority that was ingrained into the construction of the estate. A standalone carriage house provides indoor parking for four automobiles, an estate office, security office, and accommodations for staff. The entire property is gated, fenced, and protected by a state-of-the-art security system. Throughout, the estate has been impeccably maintained, and the security systems and technology guarding it are the most state-of-the-art available.

Unquestionably, Merrywood is the finest private estate, both in amenities and historical significance, in the Washington, DC region.
