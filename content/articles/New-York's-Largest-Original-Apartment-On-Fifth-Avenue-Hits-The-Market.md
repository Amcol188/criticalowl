Once the most expensive apartment for sale in New York City, the residence of the late Solomon Brothers CEO John Gutfreund and his wife, Susan, has reduced in price yet again. When the 12,000-square-feet Fifth Avenue duplex first hit the market for $120 million in 2016, it was the most expensive listing in the city. It later dropped to $96 million, and finally to its current listing, $76 million.

Spread across the 7th and 8th floors of this famous Fifth Avenue Co-op, the 20-room apartment features loads of natural light and sweeping of Central Park. The residence located directly across from the Central Park Zoo at one of New York City's most prestigious addresses - 834 Fifth Avenue.

834 Fifth Avenue has been home to names like Richard Murdoch, Elizabeth Arden and Charles Schwab, to name a few. The limestone-clad building was originally designed by renowned Manhattan architect Rosario Candela in 1931, and is widely considered to be one of his finest works.

Laurance Rockefeller bought the building before turning it into a cooperative, and continued living in the penthouse triplex for nearly fifty years. His was one of just 24 apartments, all with as high-level service and privacy as you'll find anywhere in Manhattan. 

Gutfreund's apartment is the largest existing original apartment on Fifth Avenue. This front corner duplex has many of the amenities found in high-end NYC homes, including a wine cellar, gallery and grand marble entry staircase.

The 20 room duplex also boasts of original hardwood flooring, open eastern exposures and classic original moldings. The 7th floor corner garden sitting room joins with a huge dining room both facing Central Park. On the 8th floor above, a 50 foot-long living room facing Central Park with two fireplaces, den/smoking room with wet bar, and dumbwaiter to the kitchen below.  There's also massive pantries, kitchen, offices and quarters for staff.

The owner's wing consists of a grand fitted dressing room, master bedroom, over-sized sitting room with wood burning fireplace, and the original 1930's marble and mirrored bath and dressing room. The 1600-square-foot wing was originally designed for two master suites and could be easily reverted back if desired.

The home was decorated by Henri Samuel, one of the foremost interior designers of France, although after more than 30 years as a single family residence, the new owners might consider modernizing the decor.
