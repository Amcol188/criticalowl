This 12,000 square foot apartment resides in NYC's storied 834 Fifth Avenue co-op.

Once the most expensive apartment for sale in New York City, the residence of the late Solomon Brothers CEO John Gutfreund and his wife Susan, has dropped in price yet again. When the 12,000-square-foot Fifth Avenue duplex first hit the market for $120 million in 2016, it was the most expensive listing in the city. Maybe a little too expensive, even by NYC standards, because it later dropped to $96 million, and finally to its current listing of $76 million.

Spread across the 7th and 8th floors of a famous Fifth Avenue Co-op, the 20-room apartment features loads of natural light and sweeping (not to mention highly coveted!) views of the iconic Central Park. The residence is located directly across from the Central Park Zoo and boasts one of New York City's most prestigious addresses - 834 Fifth Avenue.

834 Fifth Avenue has become a famous address not just due to the luxury of the properties it contains, but to the well-known individuals who have resided in these properties throughout the years. Among these residents have been Richard Murdoch, Elizabeth Arden and Charles Schwab (to name a few). The limestone-clad building was originally designed by renowned Manhattan architect Rosario Candela in 1931 and is widely considered to be one of his finest works.

Laurance Rockefeller bought the building before turning it into a cooperative, continuing to live in the penthouse triplex for nearly fifty years. His was one of just 24 apartments, an exclusive few residencies who enjoyed the highest level of luxury in their amenities and services that New York City had to offer.

Gutfreund's apartment is the largest existing original apartment on Fifth Avenue. This front corner duplex has many of the amenities found in high-end NYC homes, including a wine cellar, gallery, and grand marble entry staircase. It also, of course, has a few special features.

The 20 room duplex adds to its already impressive array of luxurious New York City amenities with original hardwood flooring, open eastern exposures, and classic original moldings. The 7th-floor corner garden sitting room joins with a huge dining room - both facing Central Park, of course. On the 8th floor above, a 50-foot-long living room faces Central Park and contains two fireplaces and is in close proximity to a den/smoking room with wet bar and dumbwaiter to the kitchen below. The apartment (if we can even call this concrete jungle palace that) also contains a massive kitchen, offices, and quarters for staff - and, perhaps, the most sought-after New York City feature of all: all the closet and pantry space its residents could possibly want.

The owner's wing consists of a grand fitted dressing room, master bedroom, over-sized sitting room with wood burning fireplace, and the original 1930's marble and mirrored bath and dressing rooms. The 1600-square-foot wing was originally designed for two master suites and could be easily reverted back if desired.

The home was decorated by Henri Samuel, one of the foremost interior designers of France. Despite its formidable design roots and the historical nods found throughout the apartment, new owners would be more than welcome to modernize the decor should they wish to update the residence.
