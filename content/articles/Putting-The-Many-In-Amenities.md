When a luxury homeowner's imagination and net worth intersect, the result can be more insane amenities than even the most ambitious entertainment junkies can enjoy. Four Peaks Ranch is such a case.

Most of the buyers who will consider this palatial estate in Old Snowmass are time-poor, and so it remains a mystery how many will have time for a swim in the indoor/outdoor pool with planetarium roof and the private pond off the private beach. It's unknown how many of the estate's ultra-busy future owners will clear their schedules to enjoy a summer evening at all six of their outdoor fireplaces/fire pits, or to take advantage of both full outdoor kitchens while making homemade pizzas in the outdoor pizza oven. After all, why cook yourself when it's far more time-efficient to have a personal chef, a la carte ingredients in tow, flown in?

Regardless, it only takes one buyer to make a market and Four Peaks Ranch offers no shortage of reasons to attract them (and many more):

- 876 acres with 15 miles of trails for horseback riding or ATVing
- Private beach with a waterfall cascading through three separate swimming ponds
- 18,000 square foot home with 7 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms
- 2 outdoor fireplaces, 4 fire pits, 2 full outdoor kitchens, and a brick pizza oven
- Furnished teepee with gas heat because why not?
- Movie theater room with small stage for karaoke/jam banding
- Indoor/outdoor pool with a planetarium-style roof over the indoor section depicting star-filled night sky
- Views of Mt. Sopris, Mt. Daly, Capital Peak and Snowmass

According to Curbed, the home was originally listed for $75 million in January 2013, then came down by $10 million later that year. It is currently listed with Sotheby's International for a relatively low price (at least for the lucky few with the resources to fly in personal chefs) of $58.5 million.
