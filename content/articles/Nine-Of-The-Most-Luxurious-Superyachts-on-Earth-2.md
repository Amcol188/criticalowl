## JUBILEE: BUILT FOR A KING / LUXURY LIVING ON THE HIGH SEAS
The brand new, 361-foot superyacht known as Jubilee was originally built for the former Emir of Qatar, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, who passed away before the boat’s maiden voyage last year. Already in the history books, Jubilee was the largest yacht ever constructed in the Netherlands and can host 30 guests in its 15 luxurious cabins, including four VIP cabins. Other breathtaking features include a built-in aquarium on the pool deck, a stunning 1,453 square foot lounge, a private owner’s deck and extraordinary craftsmanship on both the interior and exterior walls. Not to mention, plenty of room for all the toys including a helipad, three tender boats and two rescue boats. This beauty can be all yours for just $310 million dollars, or 15.5 million easy payments of $19.95.

The metallic blue exterior is an architectural marvel with its undulating lines creating a visual effect that mimics additional decks.

The dazzling interior work comes from Sorgiovanni Design, and is adorned with marble, silk carpets and crystal; all of which is accented by touches of gold, white and light blue.

Jubilee’s owner can lounge on a private deck, and the yacht can also host up to 30 guests in one of 15 ultra-luxurious cabins.
